Configuration

The shell used defaults to $SHELL on Linux and macOS, PowerShell on Windows 10 and cmd.exe on earlier versions of Windows. 
These can be overridden manually by setting terminal.integrated.shell.* in user settings. 
Arguments can be passed to the terminal shell using the terminal.integrated.shellArgs.* user settings.

Note: For enhanced security, such settings can only be defined in user settings and not at workspace scope.

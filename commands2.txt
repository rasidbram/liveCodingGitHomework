Managing multiple terminals

You can create multiple terminals open to different locations and easily navigate between them. 
Terminal instances can be added by clicking the plus icon on the top-right of the TERMINAL panel or by triggering the Ctrl+Shift+` command. 
This action creates another entry in the drop-down list that can be used to switch between them.

Multiple Terminals

Remove terminal instances by pressing the trash can button.

Tip: If you use multiple terminals extensively, you can add key bindings for the focusNext, focusPrevious and kill commands outlined 
in the Key Bindings section to allow navigation between them using only the keyboard.
